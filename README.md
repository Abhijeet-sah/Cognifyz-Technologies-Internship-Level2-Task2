## 📂 Dataset Description  
The dataset contains restaurant-related information with columns such as:  
- **Restaurant ID** – Unique identifier for restaurants  
- **Restaurant Name**  
- **City, Country**  
- **Price range** – Price level (1 to 4)  
- **Aggregate rating** – Average customer rating  
- **Rating color** – Color code representing rating category  

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1. Importing required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)  
2. Loading the dataset (`Dataset .csv`)  
3. Preprocessing (handling missing values, checking column types)  
4. Exploratory analysis and visualization

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing  
- Checked missing values  
- Verified data types  
- Cleaned dataset for analysis  

---

## 📊 Analysis & Visualizations  

### 🔹 Most Common Price Range  
- Identified the **most frequent price range** across all restaurants.  
- Visualized using a **bar chart**.  

### 🔹 Average Rating per Price Range  
- Calculated the **average rating** for each price range.  
- Displayed results in both tabular and **bar chart** format.  

### 🔹 Color Mapping  
- Mapped each price range with its most frequent **rating color**.  
- Visualized average ratings with **colored bars** for easy interpretation.  

---

## ✅ Results  
- The **most common price range** is **X**.  
- The **average ratings** vary across price ranges.  
- The price range with the **highest average rating** is represented by the color **Y**.  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion  
- Higher price ranges tend to have (better/worse) ratings (depending on dataset).  
- Rating colors effectively highlight customer satisfaction levels.  
- This analysis can help in **business decision-making** and **market insights**.
